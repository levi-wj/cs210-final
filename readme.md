# cs210-final

## Game Description
I will make a fast-paced 2D platforming sidescroller, with a tranformation mechanic and a progression of different forest levels.

## Game Theme
The theme of the game is forest and nature. You will play as an archer who lives in a small tribe in the forest. Your purpose is to clense the forest from monsters and invaders, while progressing further into the center of the forest.

## Primary Mechanics
The platforming mechanics will be focused on speed, railgrinding, and setting up satisfying combos. The archer character will be able to transform into a bird which willl allow flight and other abilities.
The game will have multiple levels that you can progress through, and between these levels you will be able to access a shop to upgrade your character.

## Resources Used
I will be making a real-time graphical game using pygame. I will create the music myself and either create the art or use art liscensed under the creative commons liscense.
